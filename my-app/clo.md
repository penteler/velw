We associate interface with the act of
 interacting
 but practically it has more to do with
 conveying something down to 
 an abstracted level.
 So the click of a button might 
 tip off an `addEventListener()` method
 to call a function.
 Another way of looking at is
 that its an interface for programming
 an application which can be used
 by the application programmer
 without coding every
 little bit of it over and over again
 at a much lower level.
 Depending on your situation there's
 only so much that you would want to
 customize. Just like the UI gives
 the user access to a limmited
 number of features this iterface
 presents the programmer with a
 commonly used feature-set to play
 arround with in any given situation.
 Their functionality is predetermined
 and customisability is limmited
 because the more you get to customize
 the more you have to specify in the
 code.
 They are a keypart of frameworks
 and frameworks are described as
 templates which again hints at
 all the repetitive stuff being
 predefined and already included
 with room for customisability only
 in the right places wherever key
 info has to be placed based on the
 use case.

.bgGrid {
    background-size: 40px 40px;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, grey 1px,
    transparent 1px), linear-gradient(to bottom, grey 
    1px, transparent 1px);
}
