We associate interface with the act of
 interacting
 but practically it has more to do with
 conveying something down to 
 an abstracted level.
 So the click of a button might 
 tip off an `addEventListener()`
 

```tbp
span {
    font-family: inherit;
    font-weight: inherit;
}

.bgGrid {
    background-size: 40px 40px;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, grey 1px,
    transparent 1px), linear-gradient(to bottom, grey 
    1px, transparent 1px);
}
```
