Operators are characters used for logical/Mathematical
action or process like `x` can be used for multiplication
and is an arithmetic operator. `&&` is logical operator
for the logical "and" function.

`id="name"` the `id` attribute assigns the attribute `name`
to an element for instance the canvas element like so:
`<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas> this can be later used to 
reference  it in the CSS as such:
```
#myCanvas {
    background-color: #2a5
}
